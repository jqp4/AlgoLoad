\section{Introduction}

The AlgoView system allows you to create an information graph of the algorithm \cite{m1}, based on its description in the Algolang language \cite{m2}. The system creates an interactive 3D model of a given algorithm and provides opportunities for its analysis \cite{m3}. This functionality ensures active use of the system for educational and research purposes, for example, within the AlgoWiki project \cite{m4,a1}.

The automated visualization system aims to provide a visual representation of the internal structure of the algorithm, facilitate the process of detailed algorithm analysis, and eliminate the need to manually visualize the algorithm, allowing researchers to focus on analyzing the algorithm. To achieve these goals, the interactive 3D model of the algorithm graph contains auxiliary information that provides maximum visibility of the edges belonging to individual vertices and the overall logical structure of the algorithm. This allows those who do not have experience in the application of the algorithm of interest to work with the visualization system.

This paper describes the development of a new version of the AlgoView system. A review of existing solutions for building the computational part and methods of interactive 3D visualization with analysis capabilities was carried out.
