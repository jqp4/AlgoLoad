\section{Conclusion}

The article discusses the study of modern methods for developing a new version of the three-dimensional visualization system and interactive analysis of information graphs of AlgoView algorithms. The system in the described form is used for academic studies by master's students; we demonstrate its performance and usefulness for science and the study of information graph algorithms. The article shows the complete process of implementing the system and a description of the algorithms for its operation. The visualization system was tested on a large number of examples to identify problems and fix them. The system architecture is built taking into account future developments and additional modifications. Work on the project continues to expand the class of algorithms that the system can process and new ways of interactive graph analysis.
